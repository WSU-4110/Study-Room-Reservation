# ðŸ§­ Study Room Reservation App â€“ Login Story

## Overview
This project implements a **theoretical login process** for the Study Room Reservation App using multiple **software design patterns**.  
It was created for **CSC4110 â€“ Assignment 4: Software Design** to demonstrate modularity, extensibility, and clean system architecture.

The code is **self-contained** and simulates authentication behavior without connecting to a real database or external service.  
Its goal is to show how different design patterns can be used together effectively.
